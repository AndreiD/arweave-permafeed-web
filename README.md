### How it works

- apps have to be approved manually before they are added
- apps are ranked by votes
- a vote is unique to a wallet
- you can tip the author but 25% will go to the miners
- comments are not moderated (should they be ?)

### TODO://

- [ ] blacklist spam comments
- [ ] awaiting your idea

## License
